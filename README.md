# Word_Match_Game

A simple word matching game developed for young children to increase sight words. Unlike the original memory game, in which users need to flip 2 cards face up each turn and memorize the words, this word matching game have all the words revealed at the beginning. Users only need to find the same two words and match them together. The purpose of this is to eliminate the need of memorization.  

Tkinter (a standard GUI library for python) was used in this project.
